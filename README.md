# Discogs bulk comment-field Userscript

This is a userscript which enables sellers on discogs.com to bulk modify the public comment field. It allows them to prepend, suffix and replace text within the comment field.

## Getting started

1. Open your [inventary](https://www.discogs.com/sell/manage).
2. Select the items you want to edit (you can check them all with the checkbox in the header row).
3. Click the `Edit` Button.
4. Voil√†. The script will show a small menu next to your items.

## Compatibility

Tested with:

- [Violent Monkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)

Violent Monkey runs in Chrome, Firefox 57+, Edge, Chromium, Brave, Opera 15+, Vivaldi, QQBrowser, etc.

## Warning

You use this script at your own risk. Although I tested this script thoroughly, I can not be held responsible for any damage this script may cause (e.g. setting wrong prices on your items to sell). Always _double-check_ which changes have been made before hitting "Save Changes"!
